## Week 14

This course met my expectations in the fact that I expected to have to make a contribution to open source software. However it exceeded my expectations in the fact that I didn't expect to learn UNIX in this course but I am happy about it as UNIX knowledge in general is very useful. 

I think that I made a good choice for a project because it is something that I see myself contributing to in the future and working on it taught me alot of new skills such as Java and Java concepts like factories and about Lombok listeners and injectors.
