## Techrepublic Article

One thing that I learned from the tech republic article (as well as from the class) is that open source software is not always free.
My initial thought was that because open source software's source code is free to view there is nothing stopping anyone who wants to compile the code themselves and run the program. However this article elaborated that the software could be offered as a free open source version for the base service and have additional features that are not open source at a premium. I suppose that this would mean that these premium features are not open source as they would have a closed source code however.
