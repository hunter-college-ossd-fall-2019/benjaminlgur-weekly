## Finding a project to contribute to.

The github article that I found particularly useful becuase it provided links to many useful pages to find a open source project to contribuite to. Such as [code triage](https://www.codetriage.com) and [up for grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/). Looking through these webpages seems to be a good way to find a good first contribution. But on top of just finding something nice the article also showed me what to look into when looking for an open source project specificly looking for an active project with a friendly community, and how to identify that a project is active (eg. It has recent commits, issues are getting closed ect.) and idenitfying if the project has a friendly commuity (eg. contributors are being thanked, people are frinedly in discussion forums, eg.)
