## Blog Week 8

### Project

The project I will be working on is: [runelight project](https://github.com/runelite/runelite). I have already installed the development environment in which they use IntelliJ and built it with Maven. I appreciate that the project is very well documented and *almost* every function and class is well documented in the Javadocs. To further m yunderstanding of the project, I've gone ahead and read all the Javadocs, and much of the code itself. 

In addition, I've made 2 pull requests mainly to learn the code base however, because the project is quite large, minimal/lazy pull requests are generally looked down upon by the community. Therefore, I am planing to make a more significant contribution in order to increase the likelyhood that it will be reviewed and hopefully merged.



### Bill Reyner Visit

Bill Reyner gave many insights as to how open source software is actually used in the industry. He also discussed the troubles that companies can face if they want to make their software open source. I find it very interesting on the amount of companies who depend on open source software. Lastly, it was very intriguing that one can be potentially paid to work on contributing to a piece of open source software for your company.
