## Week 4 class activity and readings.

1. The Git activity that we did in class, was a very helpful way to understand merge conflicts and how to resolve them. I have in the past only used git on my own projects and so I have never experienced merge conflicts before. Therefore I think that this was a very useful activity to me, as it allowed me to experience merge conflicts and their resolution.

2. The first article was great at putting into perspective that finding a good first contribution to open source can be difficult and intimidating but it shows a good way to be able to make that leap. The second article does seem like a very useful place to make sure that I am contributing properly and benefit the community in a way that does not interfere with future contributions and makes the project better not just in the present but in the future too.
